* No Clown Fiesta for Emacs

[[https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v3-green.svg]] [[https://img.shields.io/badge/Emacs-24%2B-d24b83.svg]]

An attempt at a color scheme that does not look like a clown puked up the source
code.

Based on the [[https://github.com/aktersnurra/no-clown-fiesta.nvim][original Neovim theme]] by [[https://github.com/aktersnurra][aktersnurra]]. Converted for Emacs and
extended by Alex Sun (ranmaru22).

If you like subtle themes but do want /a little/ color in your life, this is for
you.


** Installation
The theme isn't on MELPA yet, so you have to use the old fashioned way for
now. Clone the repo, copy (or symlink) the ~no-clown-fiesta-theme.el~ into your
load-path~, and ~(load-theme 'no-clown-fiesta t)~.

Or you can use ~straight.el~.

#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package no-clown-fiesta-theme
    :straight
    '(no-clown-fiesta-theme :type git :host github
                            :repo "ranmaru22/no-clown-fiesta-theme.el")
    :config
    (load-theme 'no-clown-fiesta t))
#+end_src


** Supported modes
This theme lacks support for many modes because I basically only added support
for those that I personaly use. If you like this theme and want support for a
mode you use that looks bad out of the box, feel free to add some faces to the
file (please respect the palette so everything matches!) and send a PR.

So far, the following modes are directly supported:

- anzu
- company
- corfu
- counsel
- dired
- diredfl
- erc
- highlight-numbers
- isearch
- git-gutter
- magit
- orderless
- org-mode
- rainbow-delimiters
- show-paren
- tab-bar
- term / vterm / ansi-colors
- tree-sitter
- treemacs
- vertico

Because of tree-sitter, most prog-modes that support it should work nicely out
of the box.
